	      	<p>Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. With spicy club sauce. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it!</p>
			<p>You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. I'm not interested in you that way. Tobias: What way? Michael: Pick one. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest.</p>
			<p>Douche chill! Pound is tic-tac-toe right? Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar.</p>

A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.</p>
			<p>I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. Don't call my escorts whores. There are dozens of us! Dozens! Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it?
